Allowed us to input lots of show-related data like attendance, merch sales, ticket sales, money from cash, money from credit card, etc.  and then also calculate payouts for all of us -- a complicated process because we owed a different amount to our label for each CD.  and our tour manager got a certain percentage of different items.  etc


Sadly, this is an early draft of the webapp we used.  

The final version was beautiful ... all the input boxes were centered and square over the album cover images, and everything fit perfectly on an iPhone.

This version you have to drag around to get to all the inputs.

The final version got deleted on the free server due to inactivity :(
